1.Project Overview:
      1.1 Background / Motivation
Spam messages have become a significant nuisance for users, causing frustration and potential security risks. Effective SMS spam detection is essential for enhancing user experience, preventing fraud, and maintaining security in communications. By employing machine learning, we can automate the spam detection process, allowing users to focus on genuine messages.

      1.2 Scope
This project focuses exclusively on detecting spam in SMS text messages, classifying them into two categories: 'spam' and 'ham' (non-spam). The model will not address multimedia messages (MMS) or other forms of communication such as email or social media.

     1.3 High-level Description
We plan to build a machine learning model capable of classifying SMS messages. This will include a preprocessing pipeline for cleaning the text, feature extraction techniques for representing the text data, and a user interface for real-time classification of new messages.

    1.4 Dataset / Data Source Summary
We will utilize the publicly available SMS Spam Collection Dataset, which contains labeled messages indicating whether they are spam or ham. This dataset will provide a robust foundation for training and evaluating our model.


2. Objectives & Problem Statement:
      2.1 Problem Statement
The primary problem addressed by this project is: “Given an SMS message (text), classify it as spam or ham.” Challenges include the short length of messages, the use of slang and typos, and the class imbalance between spam and non-spam messages.



     2.2 Objectives
The project aims to achieve the following goals:
•	Develop a predictive model with high precision and recall for spam messages.
•	Experiment with various machine learning algorithms.
•	Effectively preprocess and clean SMS text data.
•	Create an inference pipeline or user interface for classifying new SMS messages.
•	Evaluate and compare the performance of different models.
•	Document findings and suggest possible improvements.

 3. Proposed Solution:
     3.1 Approach / Methodology
We will employ supervised learning techniques, utilizing text features such as bag-of-words and TF-IDF for model training and evaluation. Models will be compared based on their performance metrics.

     3.2 Pipeline Overview
The proposed pipeline consists of the following steps:
•	Raw SMS input
•	Preprocessing (cleaning and tokenization)
•	Feature extraction
•	Model selection and training
•	Prediction and output classification
     3.3 Justification of Choices
Our preprocessing choices, including text normalization and tokenization, are essential for handling the nuances of SMS text. We will choose models based on their performance in previous literature, with a focus on those known for handling text data effectively.

 6.2 Component Descriptions
•	**Input**: Accepts raw SMS messages.
•	**Preprocessing**: Cleans and normalizes text.
•	**Feature Extraction**: Converts text to numerical representation.
•	**Model**: The trained machine learning model for classification.

  6.3 DataFlow
During training, the system processes the SMS dataset, extracts features, and trains the model. During inference, a new SMS flows through the preprocessing and feature extraction stages before being classified by the model, with the output displayed to the user.


 7. Implementation Steps:
	Data acquisition/loading
	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	Text preprocessing: lowercase, punctuation removal, tokenization, stopwords removal, emmatization/stemming
	Feature extraction using CountVectorizer/TF-IDF
	Train-test split (e.g., 80:20), optionally cross-validation
	Model training: baseline (Naive Bayes) followed by other models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
	Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearch/RandomizedSearch
	Model evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC/AUC
	Error analysis to review misclassified messages
	Save model + vectorizer
	Build inference module/script
	(Optional) UI/Web deployment
	Testing on new unseen messages
	Documentation, packaging, and reporting

•	Sample input: "Congratulations! You've won a $1000 Walmart gift card. Click here to claim."
•	Sample output: "Prediction: spam (Confidence: 92%)"

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# 2. Encode labels: ham = 0, spam = 1
df['label'] = df['label'].map({'ham': 0, 'spam': 1})

# 3. Split data

# 6. Evaluate model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_vec)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

# 7. Predict new SMS

    text_vec = vectorizer.transform([text])
    pred = model.predict(text_vec)[0]
    return "Spam" if pred == 1 else "Ham"

# Example
